**Pramp mock interviews**<br>
I praticed mock interivews on pramp.com over 300 sessions, each session lasts one hour. I chose to work on same set of algorithms 10 times. Amazing learning experience, I can tell the difference from the beginning and the end. <br>

**Interviewer on interviewing.io**<br>
I started as an interviewer in January 2018. I could not have chance to be interviewed, and my rating is below the average. I just push myself to learn how to be a good interviewer in the community.<br>

**PersonalFinanceJulia**<br>
I like to be a good problem solver. I decided to start to work on personal finance and learn by myself starting from Nov. 2018. I like to have my own home instead of renting in Vancouver area, so I decide to work on my personal finance and figure out how I can build wealth and grow rich. I like to learn how to build good personal finance habits. <br>

It was so hard for me to take my own case to work on appeal for leave in Canadian Federal court starting from January 2009.

**January 7, 2019**<br>

It is the beginning of 2019. It is the day one for me to open a repository called landlordJulia. I like to push myself to get organized and learn more about personal finance and serve people better as a landlord.
