It is the beginning of 2019. I like to put together all repository together and make it easy to navigate and find the repository for myself. <br>

**Road to C# Excellence**<br>
I am still a full time programmer. I like to find creative ways to challenge myself as a coder and also a designer. I like to learn how the language is designed in so many ways. Stay tuned. One day I will rush to learn more, and then I will write down more on the repository. <br>

**Pramp mock interviews**<br>
I chose to work on same set of algorithms 10 times. I understand that each round of interview I had different concerns. The experience was so rewarding. <br>

**Interviewer on interviewing.io**<br>
I started as an interviewer in January 2018. I could not have chance to be interviewed, and my rating is below the average. I just push myself to learn how to be a good interviewer in the community.<br>

**January 7, 2019**<br>

It is the beginning of 2019. It is the day one for me to open a repository called landlordJulia. I like to push myself to get organized and learn more about personal finance and serve people better as a landlord.
